CloudNet v4 is an open source and free to use, Node-based service management tool made for everyone. You can use it for
your small, upcoming network or in a cluster for hundreds of players spread across multiple servers.

CloudNet in its core, without any modules loaded is only capable of starting and managing services (optionally in a
cluster). While CloudNet was always focused on Minecraft server/proxy software, it's possible to start any kind of game
server using the provided implementation, or by extending CloudNet with a module. Additional features, such as
registering started servers to a proxy are opt-in by modules. This allows the maximum flexibility - if you don't want to
use something, just uninstall it.
